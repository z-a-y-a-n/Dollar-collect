## Pygame
  _Welcome to pygame! Once you've got pygame installed (pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame for most people), the next question is how to get a game loop running. Pygame, unlike some other libraries, gives you full control of program execution. That freedom means it is easy to mess up in your initial steps._
